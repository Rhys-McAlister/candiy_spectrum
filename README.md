# CANDIY-spectrum

Human analyis of chemical spectra such as Mass Spectra (MS), Infra-Red Specta (FTIR), and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance is both time consuming and potentially inaccurate. This project aims to develop a set of methodologies incorporating these spectra for the prediction of chemical functional groups and structures.

This project is a stub, but we hope that it will spur development of machine learning methods for the analysis of chemical spectra.
